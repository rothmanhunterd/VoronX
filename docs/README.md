The 2.85mm filament enables larger nozzle sizes, for example the standard nozzle size for this printer is 2.4mm. This is a standard cartesian pritner with a flying gantry. The X and Y axis are driven independetly by two motors each. The Z axis is driven by 4 lead screws. This printer is configured with Klipper firmware and uses MainSail interface.
